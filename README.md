# ![To do](https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/951/951858.svg =64x64) Todo-List

## A responsive Todo List

Feel free to contribute!

### How to use? !IMPORTANT

Clicking on the todo text sets to In-progress<br/>
Clicking on the tick button sets to done<br/>
Clicking on the bin deletes the todo<br/>

### Media Queries

Added two media queries to make site as responsive as possible
for max-screen-width: 535px,670px

### Future Updates:
1. Adding a due date(Didn't add one right one cause it would break the site)<br/>
2. Cool Background Animation<br/>

### Note:
1. Although I did added webkits the gradient background animation may show irregular behaviour on some devices sometimes(Mainly in Landscape mode)<br/>
2. I Haven't given attribute to the authors of images I have used on this website as the website is still in bulid phase, will do once work is complete!
